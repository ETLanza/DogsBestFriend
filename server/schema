User Sign Up"

	dogs.nathanlanza.com/users/

?? Still unsure about this whole step as far as storing them on the server goes, but i'm pretty sure i'm just over thinking it

User Login:

	dogs.nathanlanza.com/?username=Query&password=Query

	If username and password match in the database, the user exist and should log in.

	If successful, return the username
	If unsuccessful, send something???

User's dogs:

	dogs.nathanlanza.com/?username=Query&dogs=ALL

	Returns all the user's dogs.  A typical user will only have 1 - 3 dogs, so querying each dog individually seems unnecissary.

User's Favorite Parks:

	dogs.nathanlanza.com/?username=Query&parks=ALL

	Returns all the user's favorite parks.  A typical user will only favorite upwards of 4 parks, so querying each park 	 individually seems unnecissary.

User's Walks:

	dogs.nathanlanza.com/?username=Query&walk=Query

	Currently, there is no local persistence with the app.  Makes querying individual apps much more difficult, if not 		impossible. Pagination for each individual walk seems excessive.

	May just convert to "&walks=ALL" instead.
