  GET
  dbf.nathanlanza.com/login/:username/:hashed_password

  returns: { "token": "the token" } 


User's dogs:

  dogs.nathanlanza.com/?username=Query&dogs=ALL

  Returns all the user's dogs.  A typical user will only have 1 - 3 dogs, so querying each dog individually seems unnecissary.

User's Favorite Parks:

  dogs.nathanlanza.com/?username=Query&parks=ALL

  Returns all the user's favorite parks.  A typical user will only favorite upwards of 4 parks, so querying each park 	 individually seems unnecissary.

User's Walks:

  dogs.nathanlanza.com/?username=Query&walk=Query

  Currently, there is no local persistence with the app.  Makes querying individual apps much more difficult, if not 		impossible. Pagination for each individual walk seems excessive.

  May just convert to "&walks=ALL" instead.
